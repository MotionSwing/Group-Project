##Purpose

Mindful is a site that allows you to view top news stories and search for books. The site is broken into three sections: Newstand, Bookshelf and Mindfill. 

The Newstand page contains top news stories. Hover over an image to view some details about a news story. Clicking on the image allows you to view a short description of the news article and related Youtube videos. Sign in to have your viewed news articles saved to the Mindfill.

The Bookshelf page displays a series of books that you can open. Once opened, you can view details about the book including the author, published date, publisher, page count. You can also see the average rating for each book and indicate your own rating for the book. Sign in to have your viewed books saved to the Mindfill.

The Mindfill page displays all viewed news articles and books for logged in users. From this page you can also visit the news article or visit a page where you can purchase a viewed book.
